<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
<p>I’m a web developer who loves turning ideas into reality by building
components that fit together like pieces of a well-crafted puzzle. When
I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me lost in a good book,
binge-watching a TV series or out riding my bike. I enjoy solving
problems, learning new things and creating solutions that feel both
meaningful and rewarding.</p>

Wix.com</h3>
<p>April 2023 - present</br></p>
<p>I worked on both the Blog and Design System teams. </br> In the blog
team developed feed and post page apps. I took ownership of building the
UI for an AI-powered tool which created unique and engaging posts. </br>
Within the Wix Design System I have maintained internally and externally
used component library. My day-to-day work involved developing modular,
reusable and themed components. Furthermore, I worked on various
codebase improvements, such as legacy package cleanup from the
mono-repository and popover library deprecation. These improvements made
codebase clearer, more maintainable and up to date. Additionally, I
completed a certified accessibility course, strengthening my ability to
create inclusive and compliant user experiences.</p>
<p>Tech stack: <code>Typescript</code> <code>React.js</code>
<code>Redux.js</code> <code>Storybook</code> <code>stylable.io</code>
<code>Puppeteer</code></p>

<p>April 2021 - April 2023</br></p>
<p>Worked on the Identity project which aggregates multiple applications
into one access point. Created static and interactive websites for
authentication and account/user management. Although, my main focus was
on the UI, I was eager to work on our backend services as well. I got
familiar with serverless deployments and AWS tools such as lambda. Of
course, as a part of a team I participated in Agile Scrum ceremonies to
define and reach sprint goals. </br> Outside the project I organized and
led coding event and actively participated in the developer community by
sharing knowledge and suggesting improvements.</p>
