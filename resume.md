## Skills

* I build web applications using **React.js**, **Typescript**, **Scss** and component libraries like **Material UI**.
* For backend services I use **node.js** runtime with extra type safety provided by **Typescript**.
* For saving and maintaining data I use document database such as **MongoDB**. Nevertheless, I have a good grasp of relational databases such as **PostgreSQL**.
* Familiar with **AWS lambda** for serverless deployments. This helps to scale my code infinitely.

## Experience

### Software Engineer at Zenitech

April 2021 - present</br>

Worked on the Identity project which aggregates multiple applications into one access point. Created static and interactive websites for authentication and account/user management. Although, my main focus was on the UI, I was eager to work on our backend services as well. I got familiar with serverless deployments and AWS tools such as lambda. Of course, as a part of a team I participated in Agile Scrum ceremonies to define and reach sprint goals. 
Outside the project I organized and lead coding event and actively participated in the developer community by sharing knowledge and suggesting improvements.
