## About me
I’m a web developer who loves turning ideas into reality by building components that fit together like pieces of a well-crafted puzzle. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me lost in a good book, binge-watching a TV series or out riding my bike. I enjoy solving problems, learning new things and creating solutions that feel both meaningful and rewarding.

## Skills

## Experience


### Frontend Developer at Wix.com

April 2023 - present</br>

I worked on both the Blog and Design System teams. </br>
In the blog team developed feed and post page apps. I took ownership of building the UI for an AI-powered tool which created unique and engaging posts. </br>
Within the Wix Design System I have maintained internally and externally used component library. My day-to-day work involved developing modular, reusable and themed components. Furthermore, I worked on various codebase improvements, such as legacy package cleanup from the mono-repository and popover library deprecation. These improvements made codebase clearer, more maintainable and up to date. Additionally, I completed a certified accessibility course, strengthening my ability to create inclusive and compliant user experiences.

Tech stack:
`Typescript`
`React.js`
`Redux.js`
`Storybook`
`stylable.io`
`Puppeteer`

### Software Engineer at Zenitech

April 2021 - April 2023</br>

Worked on the Identity project which aggregates multiple applications into one access point. Created static and interactive websites for authentication and account/user management. Although, my main focus was on the UI, I was eager to work on our backend services as well. I got familiar with serverless deployments and AWS tools such as lambda. Of course, as a part of a team I participated in Agile Scrum ceremonies to define and reach sprint goals. </br>
Outside the project I organized and led coding event and actively participated in the developer community by sharing knowledge and suggesting improvements.
