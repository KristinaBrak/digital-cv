## Skills

## Experience


### Frontend Developer at Wix.com

April 2023 - present</br>

Familiar with micro-frontend architecture from two points of view - product & design system library. While working on a blog I have sharpened my state management, functional programming, typescript and styling skills. Maintained and developed blog feed, post apps. One of biggest tasks that I took ownership of was implementing flow of post creation with the help of AI.
Currently working in Wix Design System team. While developing a broadly used library I design modular and reusable components, implement and provide teskits, style using design tokens, ensure components meet accessibility best practices and write visual & unit tests.
Working in these teams broaden my understanding on micro-frontend principles - how teams interact, how decisions are made and how to find fast and best solution.

Tech stack:
`Typescript`
`React.js`
`Redux.js`
`Storybook`
`stylable.io`
`Puppeteer`

### Software Engineer at Zenitech

April 2021 - April 2023</br>

Worked on the Identity project which aggregates multiple applications into one access point. Created static and interactive websites for authentication and account/user management. Although, my main focus was on the UI, I was eager to work on our backend services as well. I got familiar with serverless deployments and AWS tools such as lambda. Of course, as a part of a team I participated in Agile Scrum ceremonies to define and reach sprint goals. </br>
Outside the project I organized and led coding event and actively participated in the developer community by sharing knowledge and suggesting improvements.
